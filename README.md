# SECDataParser

This project does not parse the official SEC website or EDGAR database in real time. This project is intended to take an existing statement (such as 10K Annual Report) and pull values from an existing XBRL document. These values could include but are not limited to cash flow, accounts receivable, liabilities, fixed assets, etc. 

# Pulled Data from Filing from SEC EDGAR / Preliminary data incorporated into DataStore folder
