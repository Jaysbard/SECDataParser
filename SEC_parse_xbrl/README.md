This project does not parse the official SEC website or EDGAR database in real time. It is not its intended purpose and it is against the SEC and EDGAR database's rules to do so. This project is intended to take an existing statement (such as 10K Annual Report) and pull values from an existing XBRL document. These values could include but are not limited to cash flow, accounts receivable, liabilities, fixed assets, etc.
